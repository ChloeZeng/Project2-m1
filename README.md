# Project2-m1
WEB 602 Back-end

What I did
1. Just transform past static web page to a dynamic page, user can add data and connect to MongoDB.
Next step
Plan to make style close to my design

What I learn
The frontend and backend are connected using Express routes and EJS server-side templates. Data is retrieved from MongoDB using Mongoose and passed to the views, where it is dynamically rendered into HTML before being sent to the browser
